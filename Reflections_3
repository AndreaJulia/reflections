When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you want to give different people access to your files. 
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Because I would not want git to push unfinished changes or mulitple changes in one. By decidiing when I pull changes I have full control over when the changes will be implemented.
