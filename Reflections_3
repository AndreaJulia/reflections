When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you want to give different people access to your files. 
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Because I would not want git to push unfinished changes or mulitple changes in one. By decidiing when I pull changes I have full control over when the changes will be implemented.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	I would use a clone if I want to copy an existing directory to my computer. I would "fork" a directory when I want to make a copy of an existing directory but not continue to merge changes from the original to the new directory and vice versa. By forking, I maintain a link to the original directory so people can refer back to it. Lastly, a branch is when I keep different versions of one directory (e.g. an easy version and a hard version of a video game). I may eventually want to merge them, but I may want to keep them seperate.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	I can work off line and git will know what the state of the last commit was.
